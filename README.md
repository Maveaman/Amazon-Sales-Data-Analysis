## Amazon Sales Data Analysis Project

As an experienced Data Analyst, I had the opportunity to lead a comprehensive **Amazon Sales Data Analysis** project. Leveraging a combination of advanced tools such as **Power BI**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **Excel**, I transformed raw datasets into actionable business insights. Below is a summary of my approach and the key outcomes of this project.

### Key Highlights:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing with Python and Excel**: Managed and prepared large datasets by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data accuracy. This rigorous preprocessing phase set the foundation for precise and impactful analysis.
  
- **Advanced Sales Insights with SQL**: Developed and executed complex SQL queries to uncover significant sales trends, product performance metrics, and customer behavior patterns. This analysis helped identify critical anomalies and key growth opportunities within the data.

- **Interactive Dashboards with Power BI**: Designed dynamic, user-friendly dashboards that visualized key sales metrics, including revenue, customer trends, and product performance. These dashboards empowered stakeholders with data-driven insights, helping them make informed strategic decisions.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied advanced statistical techniques to further interpret sales data, highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) and pinpointing areas for potential business growth.

- **Powerful Presentations**: Delivered clear and impactful presentations that communicated findings and strategic recommendations to senior stakeholders, enabling actionable decision-making.


By combining robust data analytics, intuitive visualizations, and effective storytelling, Iâ€™m committed to turning complex data into insights that drive tangible business outcomes. For more details or inquiries regarding this project, feel free to reach out.
